## Acknowledgments üôå

This learning plan has been developed with the help of the following amazing resources:

- A collection of C language tutorials, documentation, recipes, and quick references:  
  [Koubae's Programming Cookbook - C Section](https://github.com/Koubae/Programming-CookBook/tree/master/Programming%20Languages/C)

- A collection of assignments and mini-programs/projects for beginners learning C:  
  [h0mbre's Learning C Repository](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C)

These resources have been invaluable in shaping this structured plan, and I highly recommend exploring them to supplement your learning journey.
