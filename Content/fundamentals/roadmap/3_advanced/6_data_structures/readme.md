C Roadmap - Data Structures
=======================

- Data Structures
    - Strings
    - Arrays
        - multidimensional arrays
        - matrix array
        - array subscript operator.
        - array | subscript.
    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue

Data Structures are needed in any programming language, but even if you know how to implement the same Data Structure
in another language, you should learn how to do it in the one you are just learning. Is actually a good way to 'translate' the 
same concept from language to language.

One thing that you should check especially since the beginning, is if that specific language has a built in function / method to
create a particular data Structure or, if you need to built it your own (sometimes with a compounded built-in function and user function), 
for instance in Java, there are many many built-in Data structures. 

Now, for C, most of them don't exist, you need to build them, so this part is crucial in order to become a good C Developer.
