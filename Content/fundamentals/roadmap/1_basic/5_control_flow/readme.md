C Roadmap - Control Flow
======================


- Control flow
    - Conditionals 
        - if , else if, else
        - switch
        - ternary opertor
    - Loops
        - while
        - do while
        - for loop`
    - continue, break 
    - goto


Same as the [C Roadmap - Operators](../4_operators/readme.md), for *C Control Flow* you shouldn't spend too much time, especially if you come with another 
programming language, and even more if that programming language has a C style (many, Java, Javascript, PHP, C#, C++, ...). 
Either way, here some documentation and a quick script [main.c](./main.c) as reference.
